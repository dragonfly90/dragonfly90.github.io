        <blockquote>
<p>Did you know you&#39;re on the front page of Reddit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s for reasons like this that I check my phone. As I sat quietly
enjoying a mulled cider with some friends at the pub, an old classmate
had sent a message to let me know that someone had posted my
<a href="/s/genetics">Grow Your Own Picture</a> demo to Reddit, and it had
received over 1000 upvotes in just a few hours.</p>

<p>I suddenly became a bit fidgety and eager to leave. I needed to get
behind a keyboard. This post was hot. I was <em>trending</em>. Two hours
later and I confirmed my new found internet celebritydom. First
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/2oeq1g/grow_your_own_picture_click_start_to_see_genetics/">Reddit</a>,
then <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8709744">Hacker News</a>. For
a brief few hours, a tech demo that I had hacked together as a weekend
project was front page news on the biggest geek sites around.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014-12-20-15min.png" alt="My 15 minutes of fame"></p>

<p>Once the initial excitement and shock had died down, I realised that I
actually didn&#39;t have much to do. Sure, I could comb through the
comments or repeatedly refresh my site analytics, but ultimately I
could just sit and ride this one out. In the quantified age, this is
what your 15 minutes of fame looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014-12-20-analytics.png" alt="Website analytics over the weekend of December 6-7"></p>

<p>While I fully expected this popularity to be transient, it did
surprise me the rate at which traffic disappeared. The half-life of
internet hype is short indeed.</p>

<p>A week later, there&#39;s little to show for this except a slightly higher
level of background traffic (around 3000 hits a week, as opposed to
30), and a handful of the super-keen who had got in touch about
implementing new features or who had starred my GitHub repo.</p>

<p>So what did I learn?</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Attribute your sources</strong>. I was inspired to create my demo after
stumbling across a JavaScript implementation of Genetic
Algorithms. The use of Genetic Algorithms to approximate fine art
is not a new one, and can be attributed to a blog post by
<a href="http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/">Roger Alsing</a>.
With the exception of a note buried within the source code, I had
not made these acknowledgements clear, which led some people
initially to comment that my code was stolen. It would never be my
intention to mislead or take false credit, so a
<a href="https://github.com/ChrisCummins/chriscummins.github.io/commit/7d2a1910c0d15d268692b7e402b93a1bc221ed30">quick patch</a>
was all that was needed to ensure that I didn&#39;t offend an of my
inspirations.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#39;t underestimate the silent majority</strong>. The number of votes or
comments that a post receives in no way resembles the number of
people who click the link. The ratio of people who click the link
to people who leave a comment is <em>1000 to 1</em>. The true hero in this
story is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>, which freely
(in all senses of the word) scaled from 0 to 100,000 sessions
without so much as a dip in page load times.</li>
<li><strong>Write like you have an audience</strong>. For many professional
developers I shouldn&#39;t expect that this is beyond what they are
already familiar with, but for someone like me. a largely
self-taught script-kiddie-turned-FOSS-hacker, it&#39;s worth keeping in
mind that almost <em>anything</em> you write may well be looked at by
other eyes. It&#39;s easy to become so familiar with writing for
yourself that you give up on good code practises. I never expected
my little demo to be scrutinised, I&#39;m just glad looking back that
it was programmed reasonably - even with some comments!</li>
</ol>

<p>In all, it was a real pleasure and rare experience to be able to share
and have scrutinised the fruits of my labour.</p>

<p>A sincere thank you to everyone who dropped by and enjoyed my little
demo, and I am so happy to have inspired some people to take their
keyboards and start building their own cool stuff! You have made one
lowly bedroom hacker <em>very</em> proud.</p>
