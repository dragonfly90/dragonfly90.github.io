# Questions

Point reading: Is A larger than certain amout in one year

Comparison: Is A larger than B

Trend Question: The trend of A over time

Which plot is better in certain circumstance?

How do eye movement patterns(cog strategy) depend on the data?

# Assumption
If the participant spends more time on fixation of one object, he spends more time understanding it. 

# Goal
1. Investigate the congnitive process of reading graphs on the internet

Cognitive 


2. Evaluate the benefits and shortcomes of different graphs based on cognitive findings


# Validate the opinions or not?

1. Associate the legend -> Find dimension -> Find associated datapoint -> Get datapoint value


2. Line graph represents the trend fairly well, with grouped charts it can be difficult to tell the difference between totals in each group however itâ€™s ideal to compare between each element in categories.
