Managing the Academic Data Lifecycle: A Case Study of HPCC

#The summary of the paper: Objectively describe paper without any subjective assessment.

In this research paper the authors introduce the High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) as a platform to streamline the process of ingesting, curating, integrating and transforming scholarly data from multiple sources and in varying formats, particularly when several of these datasets lack common attributes to support the integration process.

steps to process data:
data ingestion
cleaning and linking data


#The strengths of the paper: Describe what you believe are the strengths of the paper.
This paper gives detailed description of a HPCC application. It is a good tutorial for HPCC learners. 

#The weaknesses of the paper: Describe the weakness of the paper in a constructive manner. For example, you may elaborate what the authors could have done to improve the quality of the paper.

The graphs are not clear, 
The dataset is small and the computation is not much, maybe the example is not good for distributed computing.
Lack analysis of the performance of HPCC under different nodes.

#The impact of the paper: Assess and elaborate if the paper addresses an important problem in this part.
This paper is a useful search in application of HPCC in academic data , a good start for large academic data.
